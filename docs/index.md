# Welcome to Qnatk

Qnatk is a RAD (Rapid Application Development) framework for building web applications. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, and to allow developers to build applications quickly.
This is not a standalone framework but works with a predefined set of tools and libraries. It is designed to work with the following tools and libraries:

- [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) as frontend framework
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) as backend framework
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) as ORM

This package is a set of two packages, one for the frontend and one for the backend. The frontend package is a Quasar project and the backend package is a NestJS project. The two packages are designed to work together and are designed to be used together.
    
> **_NOTE:_**  Also, since this is still under development there is no npm package available but you have to include this **as a git submodule**.
